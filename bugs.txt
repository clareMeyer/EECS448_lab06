BUGS:

1. isEmpty()
    this method always returns true regardless of if there are any nodes in the list or not.

2. addBack()
    this method acts as addFront(). Instead of adding to the back of the list it adds the node to the front.

3. removeBack()
    this method does nothing. It does not remove anything from the list and does not change it in any way.

4. removeFront()
    this method does nothing. It does not remove anything from the list and does not change it in any way.
